Brief Procedure for Lithium-Ion Battery Simulation Experiment (Virtual Lab): <br>
1. Open the virtual lab platform and select the lithium-ion battery simulation module.<br>
2. Set initial parameters such as battery type, state of charge, temperature, and load/resistance.<br>
3. Start the simulation to observe the charging and discharging cycles.<br>
4. Record key outputs: voltage, current, and state of charge over time.<br>
5. Analyze how changing parameters affects battery performance and interpret the results
